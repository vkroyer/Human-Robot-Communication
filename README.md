# Robot go brr

## TODO stuff

- make it better

## New stuff

<!-- - Used another Google speech-to-text streaming example as template (possibly fixed problem with robot recognizing own voice??) -->
- Added "I will repeat.." for response when human doesn't understand directions
<!-- - Use Google speech-to-text alternative interpretations in addition to the top alternative, in case the correct interpretation of the human's question/response is one of the other alternatives -->

## Requirements

Need to make a Google project and activate the Google Cloud Speech-to-text API

``pip install --upgrade google-cloud-texttospeech``
